# Bringing Old Photo Back to Life

This project uses deep learning to restore and enhance old, faded, or damaged photographs. It is based on the paper _"Bringing Old Photos Back to Life"_ and leverages a multi-stage pipeline for image enhancement, face detection, and colorization.

## üß† Project Overview

Many old photos suffer from various types of degradation such as blur, noise, scratches, and fading. This project aims to:

- Detect and enhance facial features in old photos.
- Restore clarity and remove degradation.
- Optionally colorize black-and-white photos using AI.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Bringing_Old_Photo_Back_to_Life.ipynb`: The main notebook that demonstrates the step-by-step restoration pipeline.
- `input/`: Folder where you can place your old photos to be restored.
- `output/`: Folder where the enhanced results are saved.

## üöÄ Features

- **Face Detection & Alignment** using pretrained models.
- **Photo Restoration** using deep learning networks like UNet or DeOldify.
- **Optional Colorization**.
- End-to-end processing pipeline using OpenCV and PyTorch.

## üì¶ Requirements

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common dependencies include:

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Torch
- torchvision
- PIL (Pillow)
- imageio
- scikit-image
- facenet-pytorch (optional for better face detection)

## üß™ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Old-Photo-Restoration.git
cd Old-Photo-Restoration
```

2. Place your old images in the `input/` directory.

3. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Bringing_Old_Photo_Back_to_Life.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to process and view results.
